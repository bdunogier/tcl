Managing 'weird' hours
======================

Request after the last departure for a  given line, before midnight
===================================================================

Problem
-------

No departures will be found for the current date + time.

Solution
--------
Fetch the departures for the next day, and look for departures post 0:00
Add a date information to each departure time
Indicate on the interface that this departure is for the next day, like <red>tomorrow:</red>

After midnight, with departures after midnight
==============================================

Problem
-------
The fetch date parameter will be the current one, and this means "tomorrow".

Solution
--------
* First fetch the departures for the previous day
* If there are results with time > current_time, return them
  (evening ones)
* If there are no results, re-fetch the next day, and consider departures for that day, after the current time
  (morning ones)

After midnight, with no departures after midnight
=================================================

Problem
-------
* First fetch the departures for the previous day, since the request date is after midnight
* No departures are found, fetch the next day (the one from the request time)
* No special indication should be required here, since departure times will be in the morning
