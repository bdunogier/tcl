TODO List
=========

* Handle subtitle output charset
* DONE / List involved filenames when generating the command
* Automatic scanner: mkvmerge.txt file in the folder, automatic scan => conversion, sort
* Ponderate freespace using colors
  - grey out disks where the file won't fit
* missing symlinks scanner + create missing ones
  start by scanning all drives
* DONE / Make best fit a visual recommendation, even if the disk ain't large enough
  An arrow from the bottom, or even an overlay, would look cool :)
  DONE / Maybe a dashed border ?

* Basic files browser

* TV: auto-detect best location for episode
  - DONE / glob drives for occurences of the show
  - DONE / locate latest season
  - DONE / check available space
  => a status output could be a good idea

* Generated MKV file check: run mkvinfo and check for output.

* Option to delete source file... somehow, maybe with a console confirmation ?
  - Also create dummy file (touch FTW!) for the video file
  - A backup could help until this is complete
